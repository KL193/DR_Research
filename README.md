# Multi-Modal Stacked Ensemble for Diabetic Retinopathy Grading with XAI

This repository contains a state-of-the-art framework for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading. The project moves beyond traditional image-only classification by integrating retinal fundus images with clinical patient metadata (HbA1c, Age, etc.) using a Multi-Modal Stacked Ensemble architecture. To ensure clinical trust, the system incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like Grad-CAM and SHAP.
